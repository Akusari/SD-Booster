SD-Booster speeds up your external and internal SD-Card(s) and SD-Memory up
to 40 times! Enjoy a new feeling of speed on your Android smartphone anytime
and everywhere you are.  Starting apps, listing to your favorite music or just
swapping data with your PC ? Whatever you do, SD-Booster improve your phone speed!

SD-Booster needs root permission to run, otherwise SD-Booster can't do anything!
SD-Booster is the only app which supports each card separately!

Features:

-MMC detection framework to support any SD-Card and SD-Memory

-Speedup every external and internal SD-Memory

-Configure each SD-Card/SD-Memory separately (New!)

-Set on system start (boot) feature

-Device monitoring (New!)

-Notification system (New!)

-Color based suggestion terms of current cache size

-Multi-Language support (New!)

PLEASE don't move SD-Booster to your SD-Card, otherwise SD-Booster doesn't work on boot!

New permission read/write SD-Card will be used for the upcoming speedtest (version 2.1). 
New permission ACCESS_SUPERUSER is used by SuperSU

SD-Booster is now released under the GPL! Sources can be found on Github.
